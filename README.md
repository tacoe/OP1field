# OP-1 Field Remote Script for Ableton Live
This is a simple remote script that adds intuitive basic ableton control to the OP-1 Field when used as a controller.

By default, plugging in OP-1 Field only supports notes. Install this script to add a range of functionality including transport controls (play, stop, rec), session view navigation, and track toggles. OP-1's basic octave and pitch bend functionality is kept in place: left/right arrows to change octave, shift left/right arrow to pitchwheel down/up while playing.

This script works with Ableton Live 12. It was tested on MacOS, but should work on Windows as well.

## Installation
1. Download and unpack 'OP1field.zip' from https://github.com/tacoe/OP1field/releases
2. Open Live and find "Places" in the left-hand browser. 
3. Right-click an empty space in the list next to it, click 'New Folder' and name it "Remote Scripts". Skip this step if the folder already exists.
4. In Finder or Explorer, locate the unzipped 'OP1Field' folder and drag it onto the "Remote Scripts" folder in Ableton Live.
5. Close then re-open Live.

## Setup and operation
* In Live's Preferences, go to 'Link, Tempo & MIDI', then in where you have your OP-1 selected as Input, click the Control Surface dropdown and select 'OP1Field'. Tap the PLAY button on your OP-1 Field to verify functionality.
* On your OP-1 Field, press SHIFT-COM, then 2 to go into CTRL mode. Hit SHIFT, turn the BLUE button until it says `01`, the OCHRE button until it says `REL`, and the gray button until it says `ON`.
